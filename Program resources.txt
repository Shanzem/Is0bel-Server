Technical:

Breaking down what i need.

So i need a setup where a web server can handle multiple client requests.
Will this effect The FTP server on a different IP:PORT? shouldn't do.

I can program it to separate the code for FTP requests and how it is handled. 
Will the program respond?

Can also perform a collision checks of the IPs using regex.
String stream the IPs and ports against already running services.
Compare strings if PORT or IPs match flag an error.

I know for this to work i am going to go with class headers and cpp files.
something i am itching to do.

So far a simple single-threaded server implementation of HTTP 1.0.
is where i am at. that would be great but i could a least do with HTML 3 or 4.

Going to work through the tutorials this weekend for creating a simple timer server.

It was going to be implemented anyway shall start there.
